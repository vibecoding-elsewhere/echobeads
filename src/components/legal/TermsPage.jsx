            the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the
            "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes
            expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
            Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            <strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through
            informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be
            finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be commenced and
            conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
            and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA
            Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
            website. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by
            phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
            statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law,
            and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise
            required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
            Alameda County, California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in
            court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate,
            or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            <strong>Restrictions.</strong> The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
            Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration
            shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to
            be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no
            right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf
            of the general public or any other persons.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            <strong>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.</strong> The Parties agree that the
            following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations
            binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity
            of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising
            from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim
            for injunctive relief.
